            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Is a truth confeſt by all the faithfull, approved by the holy Ghoſt, and pend by a chiefe Scribe thereof, that all Scripture is given by inſpiration from God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17. and is profitable for doctrine, for reproofe, for correction for inſtruction in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that the man of God may be perfect, thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed unto all good works, for, as S. Peter ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20, 21. All Chriſtians, before they goe to practiſe the life of faith, they muſt know this firſt, that no propheſie of the Scripture is of any private interpretation, [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Non enim hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana voluntate, vel loquentis, vel audientis:</hi> Corran. <hi>Sicut prophetae, non ſua, ſed Dei verba ſcribebant, ita lector, non ſua interpretatione uti debet, ne à fide exorbitet.</hi> Gloſſ.] (whether you referre it to the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, or auditors) for the propheſie came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake, as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt. He that was the Author, was alſo the Interpreter of them, and that which was ſpoken to one man, was applicable to more, that which was denounced againſt ſome perſons or Nations, appertained to others alſo, and that which was promiſed in generall, belongs to every faithfull man to make his owne: For inſtance,
<pb facs="tcp:113770:9"/> Abrahams faith was accounted to him for righteouſneſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. Now S. Paul is interpreter, that it was not written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed unto him: but for us alſo, to whom it ſhall be imputed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 23, 24. If we beleeve on him that raiſed up our Lord Ieſus from the dead, for the rule of Abrahams juſtification, and of all the faithfull, is one, <hi>[Una eſt, &amp; perpetua, tum in Abrahamo, tum in omnibus fidelibus juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouis regula,</hi> viz. <hi>In Deum, qui (in Chriſto mediatore noſtro, expiatis noſtris peccatis) cundem à mortuis excitavit, ut &amp; nos juſtificati in eo ſervemur.</hi> Bezae not. in locum.] and perpetuall; to wit, in God, who (in Chriſt our mediatour, baving by his bloud expiated our ſins) hath raiſed him from the dead, that ſo we may be both juſtified, and ſaved by him. The promiſe particulariz'd to Ioſhua, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1. 5. As I was with Moſes, ſo I will be with thee, I will not faile thee, nor forſake thee, is in generall applied to all the faithfull, whoſe converſation is without covetouſneſſe, as the Apoſtle expounds it, as a motive to contentation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. for he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee; Therefore let your converſation be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out covetouſneſſe, &amp; be content with ſuch things as you have. For, as learned Iunius obſerves, that promiſe given to the Captaine, appertained to all his ſouldiers, even to the whole houſhold of God, which were of the ſame faith with him, concerning the promiſed land, and therefore it belongs to the whole Church of God; Now, in theſe dayes, as well as it did to the Iews, over whom he was Captaine; <hi>[Ac proinde, tam ad Eccleſiam temporis hujus pertinere, quam ad illam priſcam, cui Joſhua praefectus erat.</hi> Iun. lib. 3.

<pb facs="tcp:113770:9"/> the ſame Scriptures, either generall, or particular lectures and examples, for us to avoid ſin. Thus S. Peter uſeth the judgements befalling on the Angels, on Sodom and Gomorrah, and on Balaam, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 4 5, 15, 16. to deterre the Iewes, (and in them us) from committing the ſame ſins, and to admoniſh them, to beware, ſith they knew theſe things before, leſt they alſo being lead away with the errour of the wicked, fall from their owne ſtedfaſtneſſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17. and S. Iudes Epiſtle containes in it, the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, drawne from the ſame premiſes, <hi>Jude</hi> 5, 6, 7, 11. Nay our Saviour Chriſt applies the deſtruction, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 2. 4. falling on the Galileans, (whoſe bloud Pilate mingled with their ſacrifices) and thoſe, on whom the towre in Siloe fell, unto the Iews, and Chriſtians, that unleſſe they repent, they ſhall all likewiſe periſh; <hi>[Juſtis aliorum paenis, non oportet nos inſultare, ſed iis potius ad reſipiſcentiam erudiri.</hi> Bezae not. in loc.] and ſo S. Paul proves the Iewes puniſhments, to be our examples, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6 7, 8, 9, 10. 11. Now theſe things were our examples, to the intent wee ſhould not luſt after evill things, as they alſo luſted, nor be Idolaters, as were ſome of them, nor commit fornication, as ſome of them committed, and fell in one day 23000. neither let us tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them tempted, and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed of Serpents: Neither murmure yee, as ſome of them alſo murmured, and were deſtroyed of the deſtroyer: Now all theſe things hapened unto them for examples, and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come, and more properly for us, then for them; <hi>[Quia ergo in ultima ſaeculi aetate ſumus tot exemplis priorum corrigi debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> Gorran in locum.] What judgements therefore I ſhall ſhew out of the Scripture, or threatnings denounced on ſinners, whether generall, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the ſame if parallel to us, may be our examples, and leſſons; and what promiſes are made to a whole Nation, or private man, if it may agree with us, wee will make it our Counterpane: that ſo knowing the threatnings on ſuch ſins we are guilty of, we may both tremble at them, and repent, <hi>Eſay</hi> 66. 2. and ſeeing his judgements falling on ſuch ſinners, as we are, we may confeſſe unfainedly our faults, and amend our lives, by forſaking them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. and ſo may obtaine mercy, for, bleſſed is the man that thus <hi>[Id eſt, ſerio pavore ad confeſſionem pecati ſui, &amp; ad fugam &amp; reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcentiam illius, ſemper adducitur.</hi> Iun. &amp; Trem. not. in locum.] fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth alwayes.

            <p>Secondly, to deſpiſe or contemn, is an act of the will, which the Philoſopher calls averſation, [Keckermans <hi>Ethicks in precognitis]</hi> the Father as not willing [Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, <hi>voluntatem ſic eſſe conſiderandum docet ut noluntatem quo<expan>

Now the will hath a lubency or joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe adjoyned to its actions ſometimes, which is termed the higheſt degree of willing; <hi>[Non excludadimus gradus voluntatis, ſeu lubentiam illam adjunctam voluntati.</hi> Kecker. Ethicks <hi>in precognitis.]</hi> And ſo there may be a partiall, or ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary deſpiſing, according as the object is received into the underſtanding, as very evill, or leſſe evill; indeed the Word of God of it ſelf, is very good, and greatly to be deſired, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 10. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12. but becauſe, to carnall mindes it ſeems to be both unpleaſant and unprofitable; therefore is it hated and contemned; yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe it thwarts and condemns their carnall pleaſures and deſires, requiring the contrary to them, therefore its rejected and deſpſſed: For, then, ſaith Aquinas, a mans ſins, out of contempt, when his will refuſeth to be ſubject to the rule of the law, and from thence proceeds to do contrary to the law, [Aquin. 22<hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113770:14"/> all, or ſome part of Gods Word, and the ſincere preaching thereof, refuſing to believe or be ruled thereby; or at leaſt hypocritically obeying the ſame; nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it not only loaths and hinders the knowledge and ſincere preaching thereof, but alſo proudly oppoſeth and gain-ſaith the truth; yea, perſecutes, kills and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes the preachers and profeſſors thereof.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then to undervalue the Goſpel, and lowly to eſteem of that ineſtimable benefit, (the powerfull preaching of Gods Word) by loving, honouring, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting our ſelves, honours, pleaſures, profits, ſins, or any thing elſe, whereby our obedience is ſlackned, his Word diſobeyed, and the preaching thereof vilified, is a deſpiſing of Gods Word, a great ſin. This was old Elies fault, in that he cockered his ſons, honouring them above God; and though he knew his ſons made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves vile; yet he reſtrained them not, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 13. Therefore is he ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. This was the Gadarens folly, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 37. who eſteemed their ſwine above the doctrine of Chriſt: And Jehues hypocriſie, who would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part with his God then his crown, with his religion, then with his new got honour, 3 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 29. 31. Demas makes ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to imbrace the preſent world, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>[Acquievit in hoc ſeculo, amore inductus illius;]</hi> Thoſe in the Goſpel, that made excuſes, preferred their farme, oxen, wife, before Chriſts invitation to the marriage ſupper: <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 24. 21. <hi>[Adeo inſanit maximaetiam eorum pars, quibus 'Deus ſeipſum patefecit, ut quae adeo nacti ſunt, adjumenta, in impedimenta ſponte convertant,</hi> Bezae <hi>in locum not.]</hi> which greatly angred the Lord: The Iſraelites that would not believe Gods Word, nor obey Moſes, but loathed the Manna, and deſired to return into Egypt for love to the fleſhpots, onions, garlick, grieved God hereby, erred in their hearts, knew not Gods wayes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3, 10. Herod preferred his luſt before Saint Johns Sermon, and would rather part with the Baptiſts head, then violate his raſh oath, under pretence of diſpleaſing his gueſts, or leſſening his honour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 9. The Prieſts for covetouſneſſe, deſpiſed Gods name, polluted his ordinances, accounted his meat contemptible; it was a wearineſſe to them, they ſnuffed at it, and brought that which was torn, the lame and the ſick, againſt whom God denounceth a curſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6, 7. 12. 13, 14. ſuch fools deſpiſe wiſdome and inſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 7. By the puniſhment the haynouſneſſe of the ſin appeares; for thoſe that deſpiſe the Word of the Lord, and break his commandements, that ſoul ſhall be utterly cut off, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 31. his iniquity ſhall be upon him. It was the heighth of Davids ſin to cloak his adultery, to kill Uriah, which Nathan aggravates; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haſt thou deſpiſed the commandement of the Lord, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 9. Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius, for gain, cries up Diana, rejects the Goſpel, and raiſeth an uproar againſt Saint Paul, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To neglect to labour after the purity and power of the word, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lukewarme in the ſervice of God, or hypocritically beleeving, or obeying it;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113770:15"/> as firſt, in not loving and longing to have it ſincerely, and conſtantly preacht and read. Secondly, not to tremble at the threatnings and judgements denounced in the word, againſt the tranſgreſſors thereof. Or thirdly, in not labouring after the power of godlineſſe, and to ſerve God in ſpirit, and truth: But to content our ſelves with a partiall or outward obedience thereunto, ſerving him onely with an outward worſhip, this alſo is a ſecret loathing, or deſpiſing of his word.</p>
            <p>Thus Saul in not fully performing the word of God in deſtroying utterly Amelech, (thinking to ſatisfie God) with outward ſacrifices onely, is ſaid to turne backe from following Gods commands, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 11, <hi>ad verſum,</hi> 22, 23. and is cenſured for Rebellion and rejecting the word of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And St. Paul reputes meanly, or lowly to account of ſound preaching, deſpiſing, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>[Prophetias ne pro nihilo habete ideſt, verbi Dei interpretatione: ſic Bezae nota in locum]</hi> and to be lukewarme and ſlacke in the law, is deſpiſing <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 4, 5. of his word, as St. Paul expounds that place <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 41. Behold yee deſpiſers and wonder and periſh. They could not endure the Saints holy admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, and were impatient of ſound reproofe, as Junius notes, <hi>[Nequeant ferre patienter ſanctas admonitiones ex verbo tuo, ſed impatientes doctrinae. Dei jurgium &amp; litem efferunt. Contra ſervos Dei.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:113770:64"/> preferred before it, by the faith of Chriſt riſen.

               <p>The firſt is their deliverance from the bondage of <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 15. Egypt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keepe the Sabbath day.

               <p>But to give more cleere light to thoſe, who will not wilfully ſhut their eares againſt this truth, and hate it, becauſe their deeds are evill.

               <p>Laſtly, the Prophet Hagge, 2. 6. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 26. ſaith, yet once more, it is a little while, and I will ſhake the heavens and the earth, which ſheweth a diſſolution of all the ceremonious worſhip, and time thereof, which the Jewes uſed under the old Teſtament, and a changing of them, amongſt which, this firſt ſeventh day enjoyned was one, as hath been ſhewed; that ſo, as the Apoſtle ſaith, all things in the kingdome of Chriſt, that cannot be ſhaken, might remain; and thoſe things that are ſhaken might be removed. Therefore, as the other Iewiſh ſabbaths were figurative, and had <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16, 17. end in Chriſt; ſo the ſeventh day in the Iewiſh ſabbath delivered to them, was alſo figurative, and is ceaſed, but the Sabbath ſtill remaineth under Chriſt.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:113770:65"/> the day of judgement, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 2. is called the day of the Lord, and therefore muſt be by his inſtitution and conſecration, as indeed he had power to do it, being the Lord of <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 8. the Sabbath, who renewed the world, and created <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65. 17. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. a new heaven, and a new earth.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:113770:66"/> fall to the ground; therefore, ſith we may not obſerve the old, we muſt obſerve the new, otherwiſe theres no Religion in us, as appeares by Gods complaint on the breach of this command: How long refuſe you to keep my commandements and my <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 28. <hi>[Cum ſtatum religionis funditus everſum, Deus apud Prophetas indignatur violata &amp; polluta Sabbatha conquiritur.</hi> Ramus <hi>com. de Chriſti Relig. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.] Lawes, as if all Gods precepts were broken by the violation of this one command, and the ſtate of Religion utterly overthrown, when this was polluted: Adde hereunto the reaſons for the ſanctification of the Sabbath, and we ſhall find them morall, and immutable, and then conſequently the preceept muſt be ſo:</p>

               <p>I will conclude therefore, that without queſtion, by Chriſts commanding the Apoſtles, or by his Spirit inſpiring them, did they, and the Chriſtans in all Churches obſerve the Lords day as the Chriſtian Sabbath, after the example of our Saviour, who appeared on this <hi>John</hi> 20. 19. 26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 15. 36. day, inſtructing his Diſciples by giving <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 2, 3. commandements unto them, and ſpeaking unto them of the things pertaining to the kingdome of God; and from the Apoſtles time, both the Greek, Hebrew, and Latin Churches obſerved the ſame to this preſent day; neither did any religious, ſpirituall, and godly man, but obſerve the ſame, tis onely prophane, erroneous, or licencious ſpirits have made no conſcience hereof, witneſſe the teſtimonies of former Ages.

For, tis a haynous ſin of which he greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines, and doth puniſh, as by the Prophet <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 21, 22. Jeremiah, that they carried and bore burdens on the Sabbath, and did not ſanctifie it, as he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them; but they obeyed not, nor yet enclined their eares, but made their neck ſtiffe that they might not heare, nor receive inſtruction. And ſo by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ezekiel <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 12, 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20. 20, 21. &amp;c. I gave them my Sabbaths to be a ſigne betweene me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth them; But the houſe of Iſrael rebelled againſt me in the wilderneſſe, they walked not in my ſtatutes, they deſpiſed my Judgements, (which if a man doe, he ſhall live in them) and my Sabbaths they greatly polluted, then I ſaid, I will powre out my fury upon them in the wilderneſſe to conſume them, and the ſame leſſon I gave to their children, but they alſo walked in the ſteps of their fathers, and polluted my Sabbaths. Then I ſaid, I will powre my fury upon them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh mine anger againſt them in the wilderneſſe, yet God ſpared them then for his Names ſake, leſt that ſhould be polluted in the ſight of the Heathen; yet he ſwore that he would ſcatter them among the Heathen, and diſperſe them through the Countries, becauſe they had not executed his Judgements, but had deſpiſed his Statutes, and had polluted his Sabbaths, and their eyes were after

And in the next, <hi>Eze.</hi> 23. 38. 45, 46. <hi>ad finem.</hi> chapter; Moreover, this have they done unto me, they have defiled my Sanctuary in the ſame day, and they have prophaned my Sabbaths, which God ſeverely amongſt other ſins, threatens to puniſh: the ſame you may ſee in the Propheſie <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5. 7. 8, 9, 10. of Amos; and God complains, that the Prieſts had violated the law, and put no difference between the holy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, the clean and the unclean, but they had hid their eyes from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 26. his Sabbaths, and he was prophaned amongſt them: And God ſpoke, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 28. unto Moſes, that he might ſpeak unto the people, and ſhew them this ſin.</p>

And yet ſo impudently wicked, have too many profeſſed learned, and wiſe men of our age been, that they have not onely in the Colledges of the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Chappels of the Innes of Court, but in many if not in all Cathedralls, erected new Images, and Pictures in glaſſe, ſtone and needle worke, yea and new painted, trim'd, and ſcoured up the old which remained unbroken, <hi>[As in Chriſt Church, S.
